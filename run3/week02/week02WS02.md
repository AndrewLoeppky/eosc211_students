# EOSC 211: Some Review plus Built-In Functions, Arrays Preview

**Name 1:**

**Name 2:**

## CONCEPTS:

* Review variable assignment, structural elements of MATLAB

* Introduce the idea of arrays (from lab)

* Using built-in functions

### A) The code snippet below was intended to calculate the surface area of the Earth and print the answer to the screen. What is the actual output (describe the quantity in words) of the code snippet?

```matlab
% radius of Earth in km
radius = 6371;
area = 4*pi*radius*radius;
% radius of Moon in km
radius = 1739;
area = 4*pi*radius*radius
```


**OUTPUT IS
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### B) Identify in the code snippet:**

Variable names \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Functions \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Special characters \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Operators \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### C) Next to each line of the code snippet write down what the line of code does.

### D) What happens if I now type ```clear``` ?

### E) Assume that I have the following variable,```mags```, that I have defined or loaded in MATLAB

```matlab
>> mags

mags =

    4.2000
    4.1000
    4.1000 
    4.1000 
    4.3000 
    4.2000 
    4.4000 
    4.1000 
    4.0000
    4.7000
```

```mags``` is list (array) of 10 numbers. What would I type to:

i) Access the magnitude in the 3<sup>rd</sup> row
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

ii) Define a new variable called ```mags2``` containing the magnitude in the
last row: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### F) Built-In Functions: Assume you have variable ```mags``` defined above. What is the output to the screen of the following command? Write down in words the steps involved in getting the output.

```matlab
y3 = max(mags(3:8))
```

**Output is:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What were the steps?**

**i) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**<br>
**ii) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**<br>
**iii) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**<br>
**iv) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**<br>
**v) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**
