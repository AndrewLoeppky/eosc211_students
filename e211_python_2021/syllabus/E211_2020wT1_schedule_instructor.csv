Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.  Usually we do fprintf in the week with remembrance day b/c we often lose a class or lab and this topic is short.  This year it's on a Wed in Week 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   In years when its on a Sat or Sun can do more practice with functions on the Thurs of the fprintf week…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. A1, part 1 grading has to be turned around quickly to get it back to students by end of the week so that they have a full week to improve and finish",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Note that the current text has a lot of examples in chapters 4 and 5 that include functions which we don't cover till week 8. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    As a result I truncated the reading for chapter 5 to not cover vectorization as this is ALL with functions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Mini quiz week 2 - people traditionally haven't done reading.  I'll remake quiz and focus it on one part of reading and give them a heads up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
