    "1.  Students will write computer programs to model and analyze data in the solid earth, atmospheric,\n",
    " and oceanographic sciences. This requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Breaking problems into logical steps using flowcharts and pseudocode to specify algorithms: Operation; repetition; decision and input/output steps; computer math\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Writing and debugging MATLAB code to correctly implement algorithms: syntax and datastructures; debugging strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Modifying existing MATLAB code,  using the elements of good programming style,  to make  it  more  efficient,  readable,  and  documented  for  future  use:  naming  conventions;appropriate syntax;  structures;  modularization using functions;  using built-in functions;code reuse; good documentation  practices; vectorization of loop operations\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Creating scientifically informative and visually appealing plots (scatterplots, time series,contours,  multiple subplots, legends)\n",

    "HARD SKILLS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- differentiate between and know the basic operations related to\n",
    "  string, int, float, boolean, none, list, set, tuple, dictionary\n",
    "- manipulate numpy array, pandas dataframe(?)\n",
    "- make pretty plots\n",
    "- define functions so you DRY (dont repeat yourself)\n",
    "- use a shell or terminal to do stuff\n",
    "- debug code\n",
    "- google your way out of problems -- this is important\n",
    "- develop a workflow that works BEYOND eosc211 -- i do all my hw assignments now in jupyter...\n",
    "\n",
    "SOFT SKILLS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- be confident going from earth/ocean/atmosphere -> numerical dataset -> code -> scientific conclusion\n",
    "- appreciate computational principles and apply some of them: abstraction, efficiency, modularization\n",
    "- understand the relationship between GUIs, high level languages, low level languages, assembly code\n",
    "- foster an appropriate desire for efficient/elegant/pythonic code and fear/hatred of cludges without going overboard\n",
    "- appreciate that there are many ways to solve a single problem and some are better than others\n",
    "- confidence with viewing/using a computer like a programmer - shells/terminals, code, vocabulary like 'back end,' 'gui'\n",
    "\n",
    "BIG PRINCIPLES:\n",
    "- coding is hard and i feel like i have no idea what im doing and everyone is smarter than me. thats fine\n",
    "- DRY and YANGNI\n",
    "- Make it look good\n",
    "- Keep your hard drive organized just like you would a lab bench\n",
    "- namespaces are one honking great idea -- lets do more of those\n",
