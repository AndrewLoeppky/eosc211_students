    "The ocean in the Salish Sea is affected by tidal forces,  wind, and spatial changes in density,  all of which drive currents.  What do these currents do?  If we release a floating object in the Strait of Georgia (the part of the Salish Sea right beside Vancouver), where will it end up?  Simple questions like turn out to be surprisingly difficult to answer. At present, we do know that there is an “estuarine” circulation in the Salish Sea.  Fresh water flows in from the Fraser River just south of Richmond.  This fresh water eventually ends up in the Pacific*.  So, there is a mean flow of surface water out of the Fraser, south past Victoria and then west out to the Pacific$^†$.  We also know that it takes a few weeks to get there, and so objects floating in the Strait probably also take about that long to leave our waters. But we would like to get a better idea of what the mean speed of their drift is, and how this mean might change from time to time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, the [ODL drifters project](www.drifters.eoas.ubc.ca) has been releasing GPS-tracked drifters into the Strait of Georgia near the mouth of the Fraser River, in order to better understand how the surface water flows out to the Pacific. In the assignment, you will analyze some of the data from this project.\n",
