# ## Question 1
#
# **If  `a = np.array([7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])`, what would be the values of  `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` if:** 
#
#
# `b = a[1:3:7]`
#
# `c = [a / 2]`
#
# `d = a[1:2] @ a[5:6]`
#
# `e = np.array([[1, 1],[2, 2]]) @ np.array([a[0:2],a[1:3]])`
#
# **Determine the output as well as the data type of the output**

# %%
# your code here

import numpy as np

a = np.array([7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
b = a[1:3:7]
c = [a / 2]
d = a[1:2] @ a[5:6]
e = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2]]) @ np.array([a[0:2], a[1:3]])
for i in [a, b, c, d, e]:
    print(i, type(i))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Question 2
#
# **What is the result of the following expressions?**
#
# **A)** `6 == 2 + 3 * 1`
#
# **B)** `14 > np.arange(6,2,-1) * 3 + 1`
#
# **C)** `3 ** 0 / 4 - -3 / np.array([4, 3])`

# %%
# your code here

# %%
# andrew's soln
a = 6 == 2 + 3 * 1
b = 14 > np.arange(6,2,-1) * 3 + 1
c = 3 ** 0 / 4 - -3 / np.array([4, 3])

[print(letter) for letter in [a,b,c]]

## this is too easy?

# %% [markdown]
# ## Question 3
#
# **This cell is supposed to find local minimums in the input time series, i.e. points that have values less than their neighbours on either side, and return their indices in `x`. But it has some bugs in it. Explain what they are and fix them.**

# %% [markdown]
# ```python
# # fix this code
# # y is a 1x100 array given as input
# a = np.linspace(0,4*np.pi,100)
# y = np.sin(a)
# k = 0
# while k < 100:
#     if y[k] < y[k + 1] and y[k] > y[k - 1]:
#         x[k] = k
#     k = k - 1
# ```

# %%
# andrew's soln
a = np.linspace(0,4 * np.pi,100)
y = np.sin(a)
x = np.array([]) # we need to create an empty array to add to
k = 1 # since we need to reference k-1, start at the second element of the array and end at the second last
while k < len(y)-1: # this is better than hardcoding the limits for k. what if y changes?
    if y[k] < y[k+1] and y[k] < y[k-1]:
        x = np.append(x,k) 
    k += 1 # iterate forward, not backward

print(x)
