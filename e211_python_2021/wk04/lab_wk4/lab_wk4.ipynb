    "vapour present - i.e.  the THERMODYNAMIC STATE*. Moist air is less dense than dry air, because H$_2$O gas is lighter than either N$_2$ or O$_2$ gas (which makes up most of the atmosphere). We often hear water vapour measurements given as a RELATIVE HUMIDITY (RH) which is the the ratio of the vapor pressure relative to the SATURATION LEVEL for a particular temperature.  The saturation level is the maximum amount of water vapour that air can hold in equilibrium (say, inside a closed bottle containing air and water, which you let sit for a long time).  A RH of 100% means it is foggy (saturated) and 0% means you are coughing and generating sparks every time you walk across a carpet! How do we get from RH to density?\n",
