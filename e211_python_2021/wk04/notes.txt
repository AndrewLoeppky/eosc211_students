lab 4 notes:

much of the focus in the MATLAB version is on the difference between matrix and elementwise math. 
not really necessary for us. instead, spend the time/energy on choosing good variable names 
(camel and snake case, etc) and commenting scientific code with units, and organizing our math 
(write the equation in markdown, tag it, then reference the tag in code)

worksheet-tues-- new:
mathematical operators + - * / += -= *= /= ** np.sqrt() round() 
order of operations, ie BEDMAS is followed in python
more on data types, ints and floats, loose data typing
--> int(2) / 1.2 -- what is the data type of the output
type casting ie int(1.1)

worksheet-thurs-- new: 
choosing good variable names
short, descriptive
snake_case vs CamelCase
_scary_ __very_scary__
naming things after monty python wherever possible
