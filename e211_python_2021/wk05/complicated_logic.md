# More Complicated Logic

## EOSC 211

**Week 5 Day 2**

**Learning Objectives:**  
1. Practice interpreting logical flow control 
2. Comment code to make it easier for humans to interpret


## Question 1

**What is the value of `z` after you execute this script? Remember that `A % b` returns the remainder of the floor division operation `A // b`. Add comments to explain what is happening at each step.**

```python
x=4
y=3

if x % 2 == 0:
    if x * y > 15:
        z = 1
    elif x * y > 10:
        z = 2
    elif x * y == 12:
        z = 3
else:
    z=0
```

```python
# andrew's soln

# assign variables
x=4
y=3

if x % 2 == 0: # check if x is even
    if x * y > 15: 
        z = 1 # assign 1 to z if x*y is more than 15
    elif x * y > 10:
        z = 2 # assign 2 to z if x*y is less than 15 but more than 10
    elif x * y == 12:
        z = 3 # assign 3 to z if x*y is exactly 12
else:
    z=0 # if x is odd or x*y is not greater than 10, assign 0 to the variable z. 
    
print(z)
```

## Question 2

**What is the value of z after you execute this script? Add comments to the code**

```python
x = 4
y = 3

if x % 2 != 0:
    if x * y == 12:
        z = 3
else:
    z = 0
```

```python
# andrew's soln

# assign variables
x = 4
y = 3

if x % 2 != 0:  # check if x is odd
    if x * y == 12:
        z = 3  # assign 3 to z if x is odd and x*y is exactly 12
else:
    z = 0  # for all other possibilities, assign 0 to z

print(z)
```

## Question 3

**What is the value of z after executing this script? Add comments to the code** 

```python
x = -2
y = 3

if -4 < x < -1:
    z = x ** 2 / 2
elif -4 < x and x < -1:
    z = -x * y ** 2
    if z > 18:
        z = 0 * z
```

```python
# andrew's soln

# assign variables
x = -2
y = 3

if -4 < x < -1:  # check if x is between -4 and -1
    z = x ** 2 / 2  # assign half x squared to variable z
elif -4 < x and x < -1:  # also check if x is between -4 and -1
    z = -x * y ** 2  # assign negative x times y squared to z
    if z > 18:
        z = 0 * z  # z is greater than 18, replace the value of z with 0
print(z)
```

**What is `z` after executing this script? What does this script do (in in 4 or 5 words)?**

```python
x = [5, 3, 1, 2]
z = x[0] 

if  x[1] < x[0]:
    z = x[1]

if x[2] < z:
    z = x[2]
    
if x[3] < z:
    z = x[3]
```

your answer here

```python
# andrew's soln
print(z)
```

finds the smallest value in x
