Lab 8 Stuff….
A function doesn’t have to have output arguments (e.g. checkinputs)
Variables in a subfunction are local to that subfunction: i.e. they need to be declared inside the subfunction or passed in through the input argument list
Error messages – “drill up/down” set of messages help you track where the problem is occurring, esp. if in a subfunction or function

```




# Slide 5
```

Logical Indexing
Recall:  mentioned during
- week 03
- when logical operators covered
Review:
x=10*rand(1000,1);
% pick out only values > 5
y2=x(x>5);
% could also have used “find”, but logical indexing is much faster
ix=find(x>5);
y2=x(ix);
