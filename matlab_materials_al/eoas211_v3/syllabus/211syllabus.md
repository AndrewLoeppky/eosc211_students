Go here to access weekly readings, labs, solutions, and class notes. New
material is continually added through the term, so check back
*regularly*. Labs are submitted online through *Canvas*.

## **Purpose**

Modern earth sciences increasingly rely on computers. They are used to
automate the gathering of data, and can handle much of the drudgery
involved in its processing. In addition, they can be used to easily and
quickly create sophisticated visual presentations (graphs and figures)
that can be used to explore and display relationships. However, as with
all tools, getting best results requires an understanding of the tool’s
strengths and limitations, and the techniques for using it. More than
anything, this requires lots of *practice*!

## **Course Level Learning Goals**

1.  Students will write computer programs to model and analyze data in
    the solid earth, atmospheric, and oceanographic sciences. This
    requires:

2.  Breaking problems into logical steps using flowcharts and pseudocode
    to specify algorithms: Operation; repetition; decision and
    input/output steps; computer math

3.  Writing and debugging MATLAB computer programs to correctly
    implement algorithms: syntax and data structures; debugging
    strategies

4.  Modifying existing MATLAB computer programs, using the elements of
    good programming style, to make it more efficient, readable, and
    documented for future use: naming conventions; appropriate syntax;
    structures; modularization using functions; using built-in
    functions; code reuse; good documentation practices; vectorization
    of loop operations

5.  Creating scientifically informative and visually appealing plots
    (scatterplots, time series, contours, multiple subplots, legends).

## **Pre-requisites**

This course requires a knowledge of math at the level of integral and/or
differential calculus. Linear algebra is helpful but not necessary.

## **Costs**

This course requires access to MATLAB. There are two ways to get this:

1) MATLAB is available in the EOAS computer labs on payment of the annual lab account fee, which includes printing privileges ($25 -
    CASH only. See Ian or Alicia, ESB 2020 Front desk, 9:00 – 11:30 am
    or 2:00 – 4:00 pm, bring student card). Note, if you plan to use lab
    computers, you must purchase your account access *before* the first
    lab.

2)  MATLAB is also available for free for UBC students to install on
    their personal computers - see
    https://it.ubc.ca/services/desktop-print-services/software-licensing/matlab
    (or search for ’UBC MATLAB’) to get instructions. Many students
    install MATLAB on their laptops and bring these to use in the labs.
    Note that we generally discourage the use of laptops in class, and
    they are FORBIDDEN in the mid-term and final exam.

## **Textbooks**

*Required*: “MATLAB: A Practical Introduction to
Programming and Problem Solving”, Stormy Attaway, 4th edition, Elsevier,
ISBN 978-0-12-804525-1, available UBC bookstore.

*Optional reading*: “Mastering MATLAB” by Duane C.
Hanselman and Bruce L. Littlefield Prentice Hall, (any edition). This
text is a very good reference for MATLAB (with far more detail and a
wider range than the required text), but it assumes some existing
knowledge of computer programming and linear algebra.

## **Labs and Assignments**

The Tuesday lecture will be used to introduce concepts relevant to the
lab. The Thursday lecture will be used partly as a “lab wrap-up", and
partly to introduce new material (this may vary from week to week).

Labs are an integral part of this course and are necessary to learn the
course material. They also build on each other, so please don’t skip lab
sessions! Expect to spend more than the scheduled 2-hours to complete
each lab.

Labs are submitted electronically and should compile and run on the
instructors computer. They are marked with one of the following 4
possibilities:

“Satisfactory" (100%)

“Some problems" (80%)

“Major problems" (50%) - non-running code is in this category

“Not submitted" (0%) - not seriously submitted also in this category.

Labs must be submitted before 4:00 pm each Friday. **Late
submissions are not possible!**

In addition to labs, there are also three larger assignments.
Assignments are due **4:00 pm on Wednesday afternoons** and
a hard copy must be submitted to the 211 assignment box at the front
desk in ESB 2020. Emailed assignments will not be accepted. Assignments are graded as follows:

>**A+**: All done correctly, no errors, nice pictures. <br>
**A**: One small error, pictures OK. <br>
**B**: One large or several small errors, figures reasonable. <br>
**C**: Several large errors, incomplete, figures misleading/incorrect. <br>
**D**: Many errors, parts of assignment incomplete <br>
**F**: Not handed in, not seriously attempted, other failings.

## **Exams/Midterms**

There is one in-class midterm (1.5 hours), scheduled for **October
19, 2017**. The final exam will be scheduled by the registrar in
the regular exam period.

The midterm and exam are both OPEN BOOK, but NO ELECTRONIC AIDS are
allowed. Both are run in a two-part format:

- Individual exam (80%)

- Group exam (20%)

There is one exception: if you fail the individual part, then your group
exam does not count towards your overall mark.

## **Mini-Quizzes**

You are expected to complete the reading for each week before class on
Tuesday. On five randomly chosen weeks over the course of the semester
you will be given a short (open book) mini-quiz at the beginning of
class to test your retention of the reading material. If you have
completed the readings, these should be easy.

## **Class Assessment**

Total marks for the course are divided as follows:

* **Labs** – 23% – week 2 not marked, best 7 of 8 remaining
(3.3% each)

* **Mini-quizzes** – 4% – based on pre-class reading, best 4
of 5 (1% each)

* **Assignments** – 33% – three (11% each)

* **Midterm** – 15%

* **Final** – 25%

This breakdown applies ONLY if your average individual mark for the
midterm and final is greater than 50%. If it is less than 50% then your
average individual exam mark is your course mark (ie. you must pass the
individual exam portion of the course to pass the course). This is to
ensure that you are assigned a fair mark based on your learning.

Additional bonus marks may be possible for an extra software project.

## **Collaboration, Copying and Plagiarism Policy**

The purpose of the class is to learn a skill, and for many people it is
beneficial to collaborate with others in order to do so. This is a
realistic environment, and past experience shows that working with
others (a) gets the work done slightly faster, (b) tends to prevent
getting “stuck”, (c) makes the experience more enjoyable, and (d) does
not degrade learning outcomes, as long as all parties are contributing.

In class, we will assign you to small groups (4–5 people each) with
which you will complete worksheets and class exercises. These will also
be your groups for the group-portions of exams. Note that if you do not
attend lectures/labs, you will have to complete the group portion of the
exam on your own\!

For labs and assignments, we encourage collaboration using a
pair-programming method. However, you are expected to TRUTHFULLY REPORT:
(a) the name of your partner(s), and (b) the level of collaboration.
Using someone else’s code and claiming it as your own is plagiarism and
will be treated as such.

## **Workload**

You are expected to read the text before class in order to be ready for
the problems assigned on the worksheets. It is not necessary to read the
labs before lab times. You are expected to work outside of scheduled lab
and class hours.

Although some people may complete the labs in the time provided (2
hours), typically 3 or 4 hours is required. If you need more than 6
please come and see an instructor or a teaching assistant.

Assignments typically take about 10–15 hours to complete over two weeks.
You can work on assignments during the scheduled lab period if you wish.
TAs are available at that time, as well as during office hours.
